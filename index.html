          <strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br /><br />Hoboballs is a game of
          chance.<br />You must guess which cup the ball is hiding under to win
          money.<br />Before starting a new game you can select your difficulty
          level, what you choose will change the amount of dollars you need to
          win and take Bianca out.<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Bar Food/Easy: $80</li>
            <li>Chinese Restaurant/Medium: $200</li>
            <li>Fine Dining/Hard: $400</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />You can choose how much money you would like to bet by
          changing the amount in the 'Place Your Bet' field and clicking on the
          'Enter Bet' button.<br /><br />After setting your bet you can guess
          which cup the ball is hiding under by clicking on the cups.<br />If a
          ball is shown to be under your chosen cup the amount you bet will be
          added to your remaining cash. If a mini Hobo or crab is under your
          selected cup you will lose what you bet from your total.<br /><br />You
          lose when all your money is gone but if you manage to get your total
          cash level to or above the limit you set when choosing difficulty you
          have enough to take Bianca out to your chosen Restauraunt.
